# SBI_Web_Scrape

Summary:
Collection of Python files to web scrape the Strategic Business Insights website to create reports and marketing emails.

Requirements:
ChromeDriver for mac or windows
Credentials for logging to SBI website. (This is not included in git so the code will not execute properly.)


Overview:
MonthylyEmail.py and Scan_SoC_Pattern.py are the two primary code files. At the top of each file the user can input specific Signal of Change, Pattern, and Viewpoints codes. The exact formatting of each script is different but generally includes Title, Summary, and a formatted link with the documents URL.

The two word documents provide examples of the generated output. Scan_items.docx is for Scan_SoC_Pattern.py and Monthy_emails.docx is for MonthEmail.py.
